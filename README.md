# Blog

This is a full stack blogging application made with Flutter. Blog posts and users are stored in a a database that is handled with sqflite, a SQLite plugin for Flutter. 
User sessions are managed with Flutter Session Manager. 

User can create and view posts. 

More features that I will work on
1. Editing and deleting posts
2. Verify user with email
3. Forgot password
4. Authentication with 3rd party services such as Google (might user firebase)
